1. Estimates, i really tried to keep track of how i did my pracs but i found that i would look at the questions, see what i could do without material then have breaks inbetween, therefore some tasks could take me whole day but the time spent writing code was actual only small time so i wasnt able to really have a good time estimate of what i spent actually on the task.
2. I was in group B so wasnt able to take anything from the code reviews as i didnt receive , how ever from the 1 code review i was able to do it was insight in seeing how other people 
3. The prac with taxi i felt was a really good layout it built up using the same taxi class and repetition for each class such as the unreialbe and sliverserivce really helped with my understanding of class and how they work/ can be used. I would suggest more time to do practicals even just one more day would have been good, as my weekends were spent doing practicals which took alot of the fun out of doing the coding.
